# Shortest-Path-Search
A program that finds the shortest path from one randomly selected cell to another in a 2D grid using various search algorithms.

This program can use the following searches: A*, Weighted A*, Uniform Cost, Sequential

The program prompts users for information and displays outputs via text console. This includes prompts for which search to utilize, whether the randomly generated map should be seeded or not, weights to use (if applicable), data about a specific cell in the map, and whether the output should be exported to a text file or not.

The program also features a benchmark option that allows a search algorithm to be run on 50 different maps to measure the averages for runtime, memory usage, move count, cells explored, and total disatnce.
